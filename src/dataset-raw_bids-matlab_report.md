ANAT REPORT

The data acquisition was performed in the UCL, {{InstitutionalDepartmentName}}, 
{{InstitutionAddress}}.

MRI scans were acquired at 3 Tesla using a SIGNA Premier system from GE, with serial 
number 000000210036MR03. The software version was 28LXMR Software release:RX28.0_R04_2020.b.

{{PulseSequenceType}} RMIR NONE T1w structural MRI data were collected (256 slices; 
repetition time, TR= 2.1882 s; echo time, TE= {{echo_time}} ms; flip angle, 
FA= 8 deg; field of view, FOV= 155.45 X 255.09 mm; matrix size= 156 X 256; voxel 
size= 1.00 X 1.00 X 1.00 mm).

FUNC REPORT

The data acquisition was performed in the {{InstitutionName}}, {{InstitutionalDepartmentName}}, 
{{InstitutionAddress}}.

MRI scans were acquired at {{MagneticFieldStrength}} Tesla using a {{ManufacturersModelName}} 
system from {{Manufacturer}}, with serial number {{DeviceSerialNumber}}. 
The software version was {{SoftwareVersions}}.

For the visualLocalizer task, 2 run(s) of bold {{PulseSequenceType}} {{ScanningSequence}} 
{{SequenceVariant}} fMRI data were collected. The acquisiton parameters 
were: 58 slices acquired in a {{so_str}} fashion; repetition time, TR= 1.75 s; 
echo time, TE= {{echo_time}} ms; flip angle, FA= {{FlipAngle}} deg; field of view, 
FOV= 220.00 X 220.00 mm; matrix size= 84 X 84; voxel size= 2.62 X 2.62 X 2.60 
mm; multiband factor= {{mb_str}}; in-plane acceleration factor= {pr_str}}. Each 
run was 10.3833 minutes in length, during which 356 functional volumes were acquired.
