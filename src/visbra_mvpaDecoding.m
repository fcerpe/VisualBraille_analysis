% a bit redundant, these steps are repeated in the accuracy functions.
% It's useful at the beginning to understand the steps and adapt scripts.
% Also, here we decide how many voxels are we considering

% get how many voxels are active / significant in each ROI 
maskVoxel = calculateMaskSize(opt);

% keep the minimun value of voxels in a ROI as ratio to keep (must be
% constant)
opt.mvpa.ratioToKeep = min(maskVoxel); % 100 150 250 350 420

%% GO GET THAT ACCURACY!  

% Within modality (maybe I need a more fitting name):
% training set and test set both contain french and braille stimuli, learn
% to distinguish between them
mvpaWithin = calculateMvpaWithinModality(opt);

%% "Cross-modal" decoding: training on one script (french or braille), test
% train on braille, test on french. And viceversa
